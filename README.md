# Sequence-Pattern-extracted-via-GSP-Algorith
The Sequence Patterns of songs that are in the weekly Top 10 Lists 

This repository contains the source code implementation--in python--the sequential mining algorithm based on the Generalized Sequence Pattern of Agrawal and Srikant 1995.
It contains the raw dataset in csv format from https://www.kaggle.com/nadintamer/top-tracks-of-2017
Furthermore, the raw dataset were divided into different files.
For each file, it contains the data of the daily top 200 songs of each cuntry from January 1, 2017 to January 9, 2018
This repository also include the file containing the extracted sequence pattern with 50% minimum support count from 1-sequence pattern to 2-sequence pattern and 60% minimum support count for k-sequence pattern where k>2.
